#### [Data Analytics Introduction and Practicum](http://bsharvey.github.io) (SEAS 6401; Fall, 2021 at George Washington University)

- [Instructor: Benjamin Harvey](http://bsharvey.github.io)

In this course, I learned about the various applications to data science and techniques in the data science methodology. I analyzed COVID-19 vaccination rates accross numerous demographic and political factors. 

#### [Marketing Analytics for Design Decisions](https://madd.seas.gwu.edu/2021-Fall/) (EMSE 6035; Fall, 2021 at George Washington University)

- [Instructor: Benjamin Harvey](http://bsharvey.github.io)

In this course, I learned about modeling the market and how to optimize consumer preferences and willingness to pay. I surveyed 200 respondents who were not vaccinated against COVID-19 on various policies to incentivize COVID-19 vaccinations. 

#### [Programming for Analytics](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~bhagiweb/emse6574/) (EMSE 6035; Fall, 2021 at George Washington University)

- [Instructor: Maksim Tsvetovat](https://username.github.io/)

In this course, I learned about various analytics packages for Python such as Sklearn and Pandas and how to structure datasets to find trends in them. I built a machine learning model to detect hate speech and ran the model against 2 million Tweets from Congressional representatives. I then compared hate Tweets by county to COVID-19 vaccination rates.

#### [Senior Design](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pfrank/classes/cs4243-44w/class-info.html) (CSCI 4243W + CSCI 4244; Fall, 2020 - Spring, 2021 at George Washington University)

- [Instructor: Pablo Frank Bolton](https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu/pablo-frank-bolton)

In this course, I learned how to develop an idea into a viable product, and how to present work in both writing and words. I developed a mutual aid platform to fight food insecurity - users can post listings of spare food and other essential goods for those in need. 

#### [Database Management Systems for Data Analytics](http://bsharvey.github.io) (SEAS 6401; Fall, 2021 at George Washington University)

- [Instructor: Joel Klein](http://bsharvey.github.io)

In this course, I learned about the various types of databases used to analyze data. I built a COVID-19 vaccine tracker that keeps track of doses, appointments, and people vaccinated to support extra outreach to underserved communities and a vaccine passport system. 

#### [Operating Systems](http://bsharvey.github.io) (SEAS 6401; Fall, 2021 at George Washington University)

- [Instructor: Gabriel Parmer](http://bsharvey.github.io)

In this course, I learned about how operating systems abstract hardware and provide a robust computing environment for the user. I implemented containerization on xv6, a mock UNIX operating system developed by MIT. 

#### [Computer Architecture](http://bsharvey.github.io) (SEAS 6401; Fall, 2021 at George Washington University)

- [Instructor: Bhagirath Narahari](http://bsharvey.github.io)

In this course, I learned about how computer hardware is implemented from the transistor level to C code. I developed a processor using logic gates, and an encryption algorithm using assembly.
